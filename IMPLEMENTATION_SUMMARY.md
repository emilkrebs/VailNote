# Combined Auth Key + Password Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Security Architecture
- **Before**: Either password OR auth key
- **After**: Always auth key + optional password for dual-layer security

### 2. Key Components Modified

#### Crypto Service (`lib/services/crypto-service.ts`)
- `prepareEncryption()` now always generates an auth key
- When password provided: encryption key = `${authKey}:${password}`
- When no password: encryption key = `${authKey}`
- Returns both `passwordHash` and `authKeyHash` for server storage

#### Database Schema (`lib/types.ts`)
- Added `authKey?` field to Note interface

#### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/notes**: Accepts both `password` and `authKey` hashes
- **GET/DELETE /api/notes/[id]**: Validates both credentials when both are required

#### Client Components
- **ViewNote**: Handles combined authentication flow
- **Remote Storage**: Sends both auth key and password hashes

### 3. Authentication Flow

#### Creating Notes:
1. Always generate auth key
2. If password provided: combine for encryption key
3. Store both password hash and auth key hash on server
4. URL format: `https://vailnote.com/[noteId]#auth=[authKey]`

#### Retrieving Notes:
1. Extract auth key from URL
2. Try auth key alone first
3. If fails and note requires password: prompt for password
4. Use combined key for decryption: `createDecryptionKey(authKey, password)`
5. Server validates both hashes

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Legacy notes with only password: still work
- Legacy notes with only auth key: still work
- New notes: require both when password was originally set

### 5. Security Benefits
- Multiple layers of authentication
- URL auth key provides first barrier
- Password provides second barrier
- Combined encryption key stronger than individual components

## Testing
- Created `tests/crypto-service_test.ts` for crypto functionality
- Updated existing tests in `tests/main_test.ts`
- Manual verification needed for UI flow

## Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for different auth combinations
- Clear error messages for users
- Proper validation at all layers
