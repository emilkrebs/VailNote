# About

VailNote is a simple, **open-source** note-sharing app designed for **maximum privacy**. All notes are encrypted  using modern encryption technology before being stored, ensuring that no one else can access them. The app is built with a focus on user-friendliness and security.

VailNote is **non-javascript compatible**, however JavaScript is highly recommended for maximising security and usability.
