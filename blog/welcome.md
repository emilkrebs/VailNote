# Welcome to VailNote Blog

VailNote is a secure, end-to-end encrypted note-taking platform that prioritizes your privacy and data security. Whether you're storing personal thoughts, sensitive information, or collaborative notes, VailNote ensures your content remains private and secure.

## Key Features

### 🔒 End-to-End Encryption
All notes are encrypted on your device before being stored. Even we can't read your notes - only you have the key.

### ⏰ Self-Destructing Notes
Set expiration times for your notes. They'll automatically be deleted after the specified time, leaving no trace.

### 📱 PWA Support
Use VailNote as a Progressive Web App with offline functionality and native app-like experience.

### 🗃️ Local Vault
Store encrypted notes locally in your browser's IndexedDB for offline access and enhanced privacy.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Note**: Click the "Create Note" button and start typing
2. **Set Security Options**: Add a password and set expiration time if needed
3. **Share Safely**: Share notes via generated links that include access credentials
4. **Use the Vault**: Store notes locally for offline access and long-term storage

## Security First

VailNote implements multiple layers of security:

- **Client-side encryption** using AES-256
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** - we never see your unencrypted data
- **Automatic cleanup** - expired notes are permanently deleted
- **No tracking** - we don't collect personal data or analytics

Stay tuned for more tutorials, security tips, and feature announcements!
