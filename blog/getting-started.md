# Getting Started with VailNote

Welcome to VailNote! This guide will help you get started with our secure, encrypted note-taking platform.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Creating Your First Note

1. **Visit the Home Page**: Go to [VailNote.com](/)
2. **Write Your Content**: Type or paste your content in the text editor
3. **Set Security Options**:
   - Add a password for extra security
   - Set an expiration time (1 hour to 1 year, or never)
   - Choose if manual deletion is required
4. **Create Note**: Click "Create Note" to generate your secure link

### Sharing Notes

Once created, you'll receive:

- **Note ID**: A unique identifier for your note
- **Access Link**: Share this with intended recipients
- **Password**: Share separately if you set one

## üîê Security Features

### Encryption

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Latest standard for data security
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Data encrypted before leaving your device
- **Zero-Knowledge**: We can't read your notes, even if we wanted to

### Self-Destruction

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Notes delete themselves after expiration
- **Manual Deletion**: Force immediate deletion when needed
- **No Recovery**: Once deleted, notes are permanently gone

### Password Protection

- **Optional Passwords**: Add extra security layer
- **Separate Sharing**: Share passwords through different channels
- **Brute-Force Protection**: Rate limiting prevents password attacks

## üì± Mobile Usage

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

1. **Visit VailNote**: Open in your mobile browser
2. **Add to Home Screen**: Use browser's "Add to Home Screen" option
3. **App-Like Experience**: Launch like a native app

### Mobile Tips

- Enable browser password manager integration
- Set up biometric authentication if available
- Clear sensitive data when using shared devices

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### For Maximum Security

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: 12+ characters with mixed types
2. **Set Appropriate Expiration**: Shorter for sensitive content
3. **Share Safely**: Use different channels for links and passwords
4. **Update Browsers**: Keep your browser current for security

### For Best Performance

1. **Optimize Content**: Large files may slow encryption
2. **Clear Cache**: Periodically clear browser data
3. **Monitor Storage**: Check available browser storage space

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't Access Note**:

- Check expiration time
- Verify password is correct
