The European Union is pushing forward with **“Chat Control”** — a legislative proposal that would require messaging
platforms to **scan every private message** for potential illegal content.\
While the goal is framed as “protecting children,” the **implications are enormous**: it effectively ends **private
digital communication** in Europe. This will make it easier to end freedom of speech and with it democracy as we know
it.

## **What Is Chat Control?**

The EU’s **Chat Control regulation** (also known as **CSAR**) proposes that:

- All online communication — including private chats, emails, cloud storage, and DMs — **must be scanned**.
- Messaging services and apps would be **forced** to integrate client-side scanning of chat messages before encrypting
  the content

Passing this law would effectively mean privacy being a thing of the past.

## **How you an use VailNote to protect yourself & others**

At **VailNote**, we believe **privacy is non-negotiable**. That’s why VailNote is designed from the ground up to
**protect you** from mass surveillance:

- 🔒 **True End-to-End Encryption**\
  Your notes are encrypted **locally** before they leave your device.\
  The server **never** sees your content.

- 🧩 **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**\
  We store only encrypted blobs — no IP logs, no metadata, no tracking.

- 🗑️ **Self-Destructing Notes**\
  Notes automatically delete after being viewed or after your chosen expiration time.

- 🔑 **Optional Password Protection**\
  For an extra layer of security, set a password. Decryption happens **only** in the recipient’s browser.

- 📱 **PWA-Ready & Offline Encryption** _(Coming Soon)_\
  VailNote will soon support **offline encryption** and **local vault storage** using IndexedDB.\
  Even if your internet is compromised, your privacy isn’t.

Because VailNote never sees your content, **we cannot comply** with blanket scanning — and we wouldn’t want to. Because
chat-control is primarly targeted at chat-apps I hope VailNote is not affected. However the future is uncertain and if
VailNote might be taken down, I encourage you to download the source-code and host it for yourself and others. This step
will make it harder to remove every clone, increasing the chance of having more privacy.

## **Other ways to Protect Yourself & Others**

1. **Use Tools That Respect Privacy**\
   Prefer apps like **VailNote**, **Signal**, and **ProtonMail** that offer **real end-to-end encryption**.

2. **Educate Friends and Family**\
   Most people don’t realize how invasive Chat Control is. Share articles, talk about it, and raise awareness.

3. **Support Privacy Organizations**\
   Groups like [EDRi](https://edri.org/) and [Privacy International](https://privacyinternational.org/) are actively
   fighting these laws.

4. **Contact Your Representatives**\
   If you live in the EU, let your MEPs know you **oppose Chat Control**.\
   Public pressure matters.

## **The Bottom Line**

The EU’s Chat Control proposal threatens to turn **every citizen into a suspect** and **every device into a surveillance
tool**.

Privacy isn’t just for criminals — it’s a **human right**.\
Without private communication, there is no free society.

**VailNote** exists to give you back **control over your data**.\
Your messages are **your business** — no backdoors, no compromises.
